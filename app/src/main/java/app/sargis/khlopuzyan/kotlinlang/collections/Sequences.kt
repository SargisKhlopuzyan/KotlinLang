 * From chunks

 * Finally, there is a function that lets you produce sequence elements one by one or by chunks of arbitrary sizes â€“ the sequence() function.
 * This function takes a lambda expression containing calls of yield() and yieldAll() functions.
 * They return an element to the sequence consumer and suspend the execution of sequence() until the next element is requested by the consumer.
 * yield() takes a single element as an argument; yieldAll() can take an Iterable object, an Iterator, or another Sequence.
 * A Sequence argument of yieldAll() can be infinite. However, such a call must be the last: all subsequent calls will never be executed.
